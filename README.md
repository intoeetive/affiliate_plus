The advantage of Affiliate+ is its approach of using multiple commission rules. Different commission can be used depending on who generated the link, what has been purchased; certain limits can be applied etc.

You can restrict each rule to be applied only to:
— certain product groups (channels)
— certain products
— products with custom entry field set to “yes” or “1”
— purchases by refferals of certain affiliates
— purchases by refferals of certain affiliate groups (member groups)
— purchases by refferals of certain affiliate categories (member categories)
— purchases by refferals of affiliates with custom profile field set to “yes” or “1”
— purchases done using selected payment gateways

Besides, you can make each rule be applicable only if following conditionals are met:
— same product has been purchased by affiliate
— the total amount of purchases by referral is greater than some amount
— the total number of purchases by referral is more than some number
— the refferal record was made not too ling ago (time defined in seconds)
